<p><strong>2. Privacy and your Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>You can view the&nbsp;<a href="https://security.intuit.com/privacy" target="_blank">Intuit Privacy Statement</a> here and on the Site for the Services. You agree to the applicable Intuit Privacy Statement, and any changes published by Intuit. You agree that Intuit may use and maintain your data according to the Intuit’s Privacy Statement, as part of the Services. You give Intuit permission to combine information you enter or upload for the Services with that of other users of the Services and/or other Intuit services. For example, this means that Intuit may use your and other users’ non-identifiable, aggregated data to improve the Services or to design promotions. Intuit may access or store personal information in multiple countries, including countries outside of your own country to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<p><span class="cgmt-weight-bold">California Consumer Privacy Act.</span> For the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Intuit shall be considered a Business and/or Third Party, as applicable.  Where Intuit acts as a Third Party, you represent, warrant and covenant that all Personal Information provided or otherwise made available to Intuit is done so in compliance with applicable law, and that it has provided all necessary and appropriate notices and opt-outs, and otherwise has all necessary and appropriate rights, to enable Intuit to (i) share any and all Personal Information you provided with any Intuit company, including Intuit Inc. and any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or related company of Intuit Inc. (collectively, the “Intuit Family Companies”), and (ii) use any such Personal Information in connection with any and all Intuit Family Companies’ internal operations and functions, including, but not limited to, improving such Intuit Family Companies’ products and/or services, operational analytics and reporting, internal financial reporting and analysis, audit functions and archival purposes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the sharing of Personal Information between Intuit Family Companies does not constitute a “sale” of such Personal Information under the CCPA. Capitalized terms in this paragraph have the meanings given those terms under the CCPA.

<p><strong>3. Description of the Services</strong></p>

<p>The Mint Service is a personal finance information management service that allows you to consolidate and track your financial information. The Mint Service is provided to you by Intuit without charge (it is free) and is meant to provide you with your information to allow you to organize and manage your finances.</p>

<p>The Mint Service may also include a service that provides your one-bureau credit summary, credit score and monitoring alerts (“Credit Score Services”).</p>

<p>The Services may also present you information relating to third party products or services (“Intuit Offers”) that you may be interested in. The Services may also provide you general tips, recommendations and educational material.</p>

<p><a href="terms.html">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>

<p><strong>4. Account Information from Third Party Sites</strong></p>

<p>Users may direct Intuit to retrieve their own information maintained online by third-parties with which they have customer relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (“Account Information”). Intuit works with one or more online service providers to access this Account Information. Intuit does not review the Account Information for accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Intuit is not responsible for the Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites.</p>

<p>Intuit cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. Intuit cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Services, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Services, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.</p>

<p><a href="terms.html">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>

<p><strong>5. Intuit Offers and Third-Party Links</strong></p>

<p>Some parts of the Services are supported by sponsored links from advertisers. The Services may display Intuit Offers that may be custom matched to you based on information stored in the Services, queries made through the Services or other information. We may disclose when a particular Intuit Offer is sponsored or otherwise provided by a third party.</p>

<p>In connection with Intuit Offers, the Services will provide links to other web sites belonging to Intuit advertisers and other third parties. Intuit Offers are provided to you as a convenience. Intuit does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products or services available through the Intuit Offers (or any other third-party products or services advertised on or linked from our site), whether or not sponsored. Intuit is not an agent or broker or otherwise responsible for the activities or policies of those web sites. Intuit does not guarantee that the loan, investment, plan or other service terms, rates or rewards offered by any particular advertiser or other third party on the Sites are actually the terms that may be offered to you if you pursue the offer or that they are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. Information in the Intuit Offers are provided by the third parties, and any offer is subject to the third parties’ review of your information. Intuit may receive compensation from third parties which may impact the placement and availability of the Intuit Offers.</p>

<p>If you elect to use or purchase services from third parties, you are subject to their terms and conditions and privacy policy.</p>

In no event will Intuit be liable to any party for any loss, cost, or damage that results from any scheduled or unscheduled downtime.</p>

<p>Your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure or non-performance of the Services, including any associated software or other materials supplied in connection with such services, shall be for Intuit to use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate an adjustment or repair of the applicable service.</p>

<p>From time to time, Intuit may include new and/or updated pre-release features and trial use (“Sneak Preview” features) in Services for your use and which permit you to provide feedback.

Furthermore, if you decide to use the Sneak Preview features you agree to abide by any rules or restrictions Intuit may place on them.

Additionally, if such reversion is possible, you may not be able to return or restore data created within the Sneak Preview feature back to the earlier version. The Sneak Preview features are provided on an “as is” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information from any connected device.

<p><strong>9. Online and Mobile Alerts</strong></p>

<p>Intuit may from time to time provide automatic alerts and voluntary account-related alerts. Automatic alerts may be sent to you following certain changes to your account or information, such as a change in your <br class="cgmt-visible-xs"/>Registration Information.</p>

<p>Voluntary account alerts may be turned on by default as part of the Services. They may then be customized, deactivated or reactivated by you. These alerts allow you to choose alert messages for your accounts. Intuit may add new alerts from time to time, or cease to provide certain alerts at any time upon its sole discretion. Each alert has different options available, and you may be asked to select from among these options upon activation of your alerts service.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that any alerts provided to you through the Services may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors. Intuit may make commercially reasonable efforts to provide alerts in a timely manner with accurate information, but cannot guarantee the delivery, timeliness, or accuracy of the content of any alert. Intuit shall not be liable for any delays, failure to deliver, or misdirected delivery of any alert; for any errors in the content of an alert; or for any actions taken or not taken by you or any third party in reliance on an alert.</p>

<p>Electronic alerts will be sent to the email address or mobile number you have provided for the Services. If your email address or your mobile number changes, you are responsible for informing us of that change. Alerts may also be sent to a mobile device that accepts text messages. Changes to your email address and mobile number will apply to all of your alerts.</p>

<p>Because alerts are not encrypted, we will never include your passcode. However, alerts may include your Login ID and some information about your accounts. Depending upon which alerts you select, information such as an account balance or the due date for your credit card payment may be included. Anyone with access to your email will be able to view the content of these alerts. At any time you may disable <br class="cgmt-visible-xs"/>future alerts.</p>

All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues related to scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND INTUIT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR LITIGATE ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.</p>

<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Intuit Inc., in care of our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808. Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's rules, but if you are unable to pay any of them, we will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such fees and costs for claims totaling less than $75,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Section 21 shall survive expiration, termination or rescission of this Agreement.

    Intuit’s Designated Agent a written counter-notice with the <br class="cgmt-visible-xs"/>following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Identification of the copyrighted work that was removed, and the location on the Site where it would have been
        found prior to its removal;</li>
    <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed as a
        result of a mistake or misidentification; and</li>

        available, <br class="cgmt-visible-xs"/>email address).</li>
